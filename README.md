## Summary

This analysis examines the spatial relationship between data center locations and environmental justice indicators in Oregon. Using EPA's EJScreen dataset aggregated to the county level and data center location data from the IM3 Open Source Data Center Atlas, we investigate whether data centers are disproportionately sited in communities facing elevated environmental burdens or demographic vulnerabilities.

Our analysis reveals that counties with existing data centers show notably higher environmental burdens compared to counties without: PM2.5 (+27 percentile points), Diesel PM (+24), NO2 (+22), and RMP Facilities (+27) show the largest differences. Counties slated for projected data center development show an even more pronounced pattern, with Toxic Releases (+33), Hazardous Waste (+30), and Traffic Proximity (+28) among the highest differences. Both existing and projected data center counties also show higher proportions of People of Color (+15-16 percentile points) and Linguistic Isolation (+11-14 percentile points).

These findings suggest that data center siting in Oregon may disproportionately impact communities already facing elevated environmental hazards, raising important environmental justice considerations for future development decisions. However, further analysis/tests would be necessary to assess the extent and significance of these trends.
